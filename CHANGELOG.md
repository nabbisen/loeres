# Changelog

All notable changes to Loeres are recorded here. The format is loosely based on
Keep a Changelog, and the project follows semantic versioning. Versions below
`1.0.0` are pre-stability; a `1.0.0` release requires explicit project-owner
sign-off (see RFC 000 and the requirements specification).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-21 — Design baseline

First release. This is a **design / governance baseline**: the public boundary,
crate topology, and contracts are frozen as accepted and proposed RFCs. No
implementation code is included yet; coding follows the design-before-code
workflow once the remaining design rounds land.

### Added

- Governing specifications (`docs/specs/`): requirements, external design, and
  roadmap & milestones (all v1).
- RFC set under `rfcs/`:
  - `done/000` — RFC lifecycle policy.
  - `proposed/001`–`009` — Milestone 1–3 contracts (scalar capabilities;
    storage-agnostic access; allocation-free errors; static storage; typed
    workspace; deterministic device kernel; dynamic/sparse backend; async
    orchestration; observability/FFI).
  - `proposed/010`–`013` — cross-cutting contracts (xtask verification
    governance; target profiles & deterministic math; validation-state policy;
    conformance corpus & numerical parity).
  - `proposed/014` — core solver outcome & status taxonomy.
- Standard project scaffolding: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`
  (Apache-2.0), `NOTICE`, and `ROADMAP.md`; plus an mdbook skeleton (`docs/src/`)
  with a Maintainers & Contributors section that bridges the rendered book to
  the raw specifications and RFCs.

### Changed (design reconciliation incorporated into this baseline)

- Introduced RFC 014 as the single owner of the `loeres_core::solver` taxonomy;
  non-convergence at the iteration cap is now a **status**
  (`SolveStatus::NotConverged` + `TerminationReason::IterationCap`), not a
  `SolverError`.
- Reconciled RFCs 003, 005, 006, 008, 010, 011, and 013 with RFC 014: the
  canonical 13-variant `SolverError` set (`u32` dimension payloads; no
  `MaxIterationsReached`; no runtime `PanicGateViolation`); device report
  derivation via `AsCoreReport`; per-item batch outcomes carrying a core report;
  `check-public-api` governance; `SolveStatus`-based conformance.
- Cross-document cleanup: unified the RFC folder scheme to `proposed/done/archive`
  (RFC 000), flat-renumbered the roadmap and external-design RFC references,
  inserted RFC 014 into the dependency graphs, and corrected the RFC 011 target
  profiles (`thumbv7em-none-eabi` soft-float; `riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`
  advisory; f32-first hard-float reference).

### Release audit

- **Security.** This release contains documentation and RFCs only — no
  executable code, no data flows, no external integrations, and no
  authentication logic — so no new attack surface is introduced. The
  design-level threat model (requirements §8; external design §5; consolidated
  in `docs/src/threat-model.md`) remains valid, and its controls (compile-time
  server/edge isolation, FFI restricted to the cluster crate and default-off,
  boundary validation, panic-aversion) are preserved by the current RFC set.
- **Documentation consistency.** The governing docs were verified against the
  reconciled RFC set: no stale `MaxIterationsReached` / `ConvergenceStatus`
  terminology, no milestone-style RFC numbering, and no folder-scheme drift
  outside RFC 014's explanatory prose.
